Welcome to the Bulls and Cows Game repository! 🎮

This project is a digital implementation of the classic code-breaking game Bulls and Cows, also known as Cows and Bulls or Mastermind. In this game, one player thinks of a secret number (or word), and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of "bulls" and "cows":

Bulls 🐂: Indicate the number of correct digits (or letters) in the correct position.
Cows 🐄: Indicate the number of correct digits (or letters) but in the wrong position.
The goal is to guess the secret code with the fewest attempts possible based on the feedback received.

Features
Single-player mode: Try to guess a randomly generated secret number.
Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
Detailed feedback after each guess in the form of bulls and cows.
Optional settings for limiting the number of guesses.
How to Play 🎮
The computer generates a random secret number.
The player inputs guesses and receives feedback based on bulls and cows.
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C# Object-oriented programming
CLI: Simple text-based interface for interaction.
