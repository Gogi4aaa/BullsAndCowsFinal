Welcome to the Bulls and Cows Game repository! 🎮 <br />

This project is a digital implementation of the classic code-breaking game Bulls and Cows, also known as Cows and Bulls or Mastermind. In this game, one player thinks of a secret number (or word), and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. <br /> After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of "bulls" and "cows": <br />

 • Bulls 🐂: Indicate the number of correct digits (or letters) in the correct position. <br />
 • Cows 🐄: Indicate the number of correct digits (or letters) but in the wrong position. <br />
The goal is to guess the secret code with the fewest attempts possible based on the feedback received. <br />

Features <br />
Single-player mode: Try to guess a randomly generated secret number. <br />
Simple and intuitive command-line interface. <br />
Detailed feedback after each guess in the form of bulls and cows. <br />
Optional settings for limiting the number of guesses. <br />
How to Play 🎮 <br /> 
The computer generates a random secret number. <br />
The player inputs guesses and receives feedback based on bulls and cows. <br />
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.  <br />
Technologies Used <br />
Programming Language: C# Object-oriented programming <br />
CLI: Simple text-based interface for interaction. <br />
